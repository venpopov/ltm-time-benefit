## To report

- I finally understand the argument for freeing capacity
  - But now the argument seems one-sided. We do formal modeling to reject the resource account, and based on that we conclude that the other capacity account is more plausible without doing any modeling for it?
- difficult to model the first chunk. In experiment 2 we already have evidence for a retroactive benefit of the long gap, but the model can't account for it. In general, I need to write a more detailed limitations section in which to express my reservations about the conclusions.
  
- there are many different parameter estimates reaching similar likelihoods using the existing model
  - for an example, see [here](notebooks/modelling_edas_approach.qmd#problem-with-parameter-identifiability)
  - more details linked [here](notebooks/par_identifiability.qmd)

### Best fitting parameters vs consistent parameters

The argument is that the best fitting paramteres present a recovery rate that is too slow. But the question in this case needs to be - what parameter values are *consistent* with the data? And are there parameter values consistent with the data that are reasonably fast?

For experiment 2, the model can predict an interaction, but at the cost of overall fit.

### Serial position

It's the combination with serial position that makes it difficult for the model. In experiment 2, after 6 seconds gap there is no difference in SP4-6 between known and random chunks, which the model can only account for width full recovery. But performance decreases with serial position, which the model can only account for with not full recovery...

## Problems in current modeling

- line 78: ISI is 0.5, encoding duration is 0.9, this results in depletion not recovery

## Questions

- There are missing observations in the data?

Do we include the encoding duration in the recovery time or not?
:  Doesn't matter, similar estimates. See [here](notebooks/model_v2.qmd)
