- Added simulations with the non-linear recovery

- Playing with the shiny app is very useful for understanding the model. I should have done this earlier. For example:
   - `prop` is determined by the effect size of the proactive benefit at the second vs third chunk. With `prop = 1`, the effect is entirely local
   - `prop` needs to be low to allow for a global proactive benefit. But then the resource recovery rate also needs to be slow to allow for a primacy effect
   - the model does not actually predict an interaction at the latent variable level unless resources completely recovered

- Example for the four conditions:

   1. 0.5 * (0.5 + r * t1)    // random, shortgap 
   2. 0.5 * (0.75 + r * t1)   // known, shortgap
   3. 0.5 * (0.5 + r * t2)    // random, longgap
   4. 0.5 * (0.75 + r * t2)   // known, longgap

   - KS-RS: 0.5 * 0.25 
   - KL-RL: 0.5 * 0.25

- I could have saved myself so much modeling effort by doing the simple math. The model does not predict an interaction, *unless* resources recover fully in one of the conditions! I should use this as a teaching example (why is modeling useful - learn about the theory; parameter fitting should not be the first step, etc.)

- add the `sqrt` relation between resources and memory strength does not change much the outcome
- more extensive notes transfered to [2021-05-16 Meeting Notes](dev-notebooks/2021-05-16-meeting.qmd)

- Discovered that there is one subject in Experiment 2 with 0 accuracy. Need to redo all the E2 modeling.
- I took a chance to expand the serial_recall function for future modeling with a lambda and growth parameters.
- I tagged the main branch with v0.0.2 to mark the big transition to redoing the modeling. There is also a v0.0.2 branch with a copy
- The _targets folder is not tracked by git, so I backed it up and tagged it manually under `~/_targets_backup`
