I will need to redo all the E2 modeling (discovered at 19:00, May 13). \n\nHow many subjects are there in each experiment?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_agg_subj |>\n  group_by(exp) |>\n  summarize(n = n_distinct(id))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  exp       n\n  <chr> <int>\n1 Exp 1    31\n2 Exp 2    36\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the current draft we report this:\n\n> **Thirty-two, 35,** and 120 young adults participated in Experiments **1, 2,** and 3 respectively. For the first two experiments, sample sizes were chosen on the basis of previous experiments that have shown beneficial effects of longer inter-item intervals. Data collection was stopped when a pre-specified target N (or a few more, in case exclusion of data is needed during analysis) was reached. N was 32 for Experiments 1 and 2. We increased the number of participants in Experiment 3 due to a lower number of trials per condition. We recruited participants through Prolific for each experiment, who completed the experiment online. Participants were paid an hourly rate of 7 GBP. Participants were between 18 and 35 years old, with no visual impairment and were German speakers from Germany. **We excluded participants who did not do the task appropriately (i.e. had on average serial recall accuracy below 0.1 – 1, 2** , and 2 participants from Experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively).\n\nThis doesn't match what I see above. Exp 1 has 31 subjects in the data I have, so that matches the post-exclusion number. But Exp 2 has 36 subjects in the data I have. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ggplot(aes(gap, p_correct, color = chunk, group = chunk)) +\n#   geom_point() +\n#   geom_line() +\n#   scale_color_discrete(\"1st chunk LTM?\") +\n#   facet_wrap(~ subject + itemtype) +\n#   theme_pub()\n```\n:::\n",
