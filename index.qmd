The current website is a collection of development notes and reports related to the modelling of free time and chunking.

In the side bar you will find:

- **Development notes:** an unorganized collection of notebooks. These are mostly for my own reference during model development.
- **Notebooks:** a collection of notebooks that are more organized and presentable. These are intended to be shared with others.
- **Reports:** a collection of reports that summarize the development of the model and the results of the model.
- **Function reference:** documentation of custom functions used in the project.

PS: I am experimenting with quarto websites for project documentation and reporting. This is a first attempt!
